# Ethics Case Study Reflection

Ethics case study blog post.  Share 3 key takeaways from the presentation and discussion of the Hive Tracks and Bee Informed Partnership case study.

The three main takeaways that I had from the presentation and discussion of the Hive Tracks and Bee Informed Partnership case study revolved around the three areas that we discussed in detail, security, data privacy and intellectual property. 

At first when discussing intellectual property I had no idea what kind of IP a bee keeping software would have other than the codebase itself. I found it interesting that the location of the hives themselves could be considered IP because of the importance of the hive location and timing. The thing that really stuck with me from this discussion though, was the importance of establishing ownership of the codebase that makes up your product . I also thought it was important to make sure that you have a reliable way to update your software stack when needed, to avoid the problems you faced with the first update of your codebase. 

From the discussing about data privacy I found that the information about managing user data to be very important. By allowing only certain data to be visible to the public about bee hive location and ownership when the user opted in seemed to be an important distinction to make when creating the bee hive map. I also thought that a key takeaway was how user data was managed and utilized for other uses. Using only aggregated data to publish findings or general analysis about bee keepers is very different that publishing raw data that has identifiable characteristics. 

The discussion about security also gave me the key takeaway that anything on the internet will be tested for security no matter the project scope or subject. Even when the site was small and just getting started someone was still searching for vulnerabilities in the site to exploit. 

Overall I think the discussions gave a great overview of all the things we must take into account when creating software and when running a software focused business.
