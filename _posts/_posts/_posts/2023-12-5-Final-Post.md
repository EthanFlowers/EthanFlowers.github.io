The three most important things that I learned this semester were 
- Privacy is not always given
- The ethics of creating software
- The importance of IP when creating software

Through the Citizen Four documentary I learned a lot about how government agencies use data collected from everyone. That everyone's data is collected and stored without much transparency. 
The ethics of creating software is more complicated that I initially thought. Even if you are just working on a small project and putting it on the internet, anyone can use that software for it intended purpose or not and care should be taken when creating any software. 
The importance of intellectual property is also another topic that I never thought about before this class. As far as maintaining the authorship of your own code and possibly patenting any new creations that you might have is extremely important.
One piece of advise that I would give to anyone taking this class is to ensure that you stay on top of all of the work and don't procrastinate on the assignments.
